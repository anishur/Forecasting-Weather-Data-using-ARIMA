###### The dataset is composed of telecommunications, weather, news, social networks and electricity data from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino.

###### Milan data collected by Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione dell'Ambiente 

###### The data are divided into two datasets called Legend dataset and Weather Phenomena

###### The data is accumulated in 60min time-slots


###### I have selected a data set named mi_meteo_2001.csv from the Milano_WeatherFenomenia zip folder. The data set includes Date-Hour format from 2013-11-01 â€“ 2013-12-31 and the temperature in Celsius ranges. I have used [*Python*](https://www.python.org/) to analyse weather data to build up a *time series forecast model*. For *data analysis and data processing*, I have imported libraries like [*Numpy*](https://numpy.org/), [*Pandas*](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and the [*Matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/) to make plots for data visualization.
